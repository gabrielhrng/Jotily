# Jotily: A Web Application for Study

## Features

### Stopwatch

### Pomodoro Timer

### Music Player
Based on user feedback before the development of the application, the music player was deemed as a distraction to most users who attempted to study. Althought it had good reason to not be included, it was proposed to initially have very little functionality i.e. limited songs, no skip button/s. However in trying it out, it became even more distracting for users to not have control over this function and hence standard functionality was inplemented back into this feature. The final prototype still retains limited tracks for users to not be tempted to  "DJ" while doing work.

### Kanban Board

### Reading List Creator
Initially a button for updating the html link was planned, however, post converting the code from JQuery, feedback from the tutor rendered the update function pointless. As this was a web application, it was suggested that users would merely add another link in the list and remove the old link.
