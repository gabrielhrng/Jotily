# Jotily: A Web Application for Study

## Features

### Stopwatch and Pomodoro Timer 
Although seemingly more appropriate according to users to implement a flow track timer, the pomodoro timer was chosen to be in the final prototype, due to time and skill level constraints. Creating an automated flow track timer and embeding that into the stopwatch functionality was too ambitious of a task and was scrapped for a more feasible solution. Users complained about the pomodoro timer for not being having enough feedback. This was improved by putting a progress bar at the top, across the screen. When the counter went down and users could see visually how far along they were in their study block or rest block.  

### Music Player
Based on user feedback before the development of the application, the music player was deemed as a distraction to most users who attempted to study. Althought it had good reason to not be included, it was proposed to initially have very little functionality i.e. limited songs, no skip button/s. However in trying it out, it became even more distracting for users to not have control over this function and hence standard functionality was inplemented back into this feature. The final prototype still retains limited tracks for users to not be tempted to  "DJ" while doing work.

### Kanban Board
The Kanban Board was difficult to implement into the final prototype, as it was a pre-existing library that had an established structure. Basic work was done to conform the kanban board to fit into the aesthetic of the application, make sure that users could add their tasks on the board and could freely move their tasks from one board to another. Ideally, the kanban board would replace the tasklist, which the tasklist functioning as a pop up menu when a task was to be added. In the end, it was not possible to combine the tasklist and the board together, due to the complexity of the library.

### Reading List Creator
Initially a button for updating the html link was planned, however, post converting the code from JQuery, feedback from the tutor rendered the update function pointless. As this was a web application, it was suggested that users would merely add another link in the list and remove the old link.
